This repository contains 9 Elasticsearch monitoring tools designed to help track the health, performance, and status of your clusters and nodes. Each tool has a unique Tool ID, a short description, optional labels for easy filtering, and an ES|QL query that retrieves the relevant data. The tools include daily cluster health checks, node uptime tracking, high resource usage alerts, red cluster status monitoring, shard state tracking, search latency measurements, and top node metrics. This README serves as a central reference so anyone can quickly understand what each tool does and how to use it.
