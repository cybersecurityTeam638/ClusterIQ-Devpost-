# **ClusterIQ – Smart Elasticsearch Agent**

---

## **Agent ID**
**smart_monitoring_assistant_1**

---

## **Overview**
ClusterIQ is an AI-powered agent designed to monitor **Elasticsearch clusters**.  
It continuously checks cluster health, node performance, and shard states. The agent can detect critical issues, predict potential failures, and provide actionable insights to help operations teams respond faster.

---

## **Key Features**
- Monitors overall **cluster health** and trends.  
- Tracks **node uptime** and resource usage (CPU, memory, disk).  
- Detects **red cluster alerts** and urgent issues automatically.  
- Monitors **shard allocation** and primary/replica balance.  
- Measures **search and indexing latency**.  
- Provides **predictions** for potential cluster risks.  
- Generates easy-to-read **reports with actionable insights**.  

---

## **Purpose**
ClusterIQ is built to help Elasticsearch operators:  
- Quickly identify critical issues before they affect users.  
- Understand resource and performance trends across all nodes.  
- Reduce manual monitoring and troubleshooting time.  
- Improve reliability and stability of their Elasticsearch clusters.  

---

## **How It Works**
1. The agent continuously collects data from Elasticsearch clusters.  
2. It uses built-in monitoring tools to check cluster state, node performance, latency, and shard health.  
3. Critical issues are prioritized and summarized in clear, structured reports.  
4. Predictive scoring helps forecast potential red cluster events and resource risks.  

---

## **Usage**
- Deploy the agent in your environment connected to your Elasticsearch clusters.  
- Configure the agent to attach the relevant monitoring tools.  
- Start monitoring to receive automated insights, alerts, and reports.
